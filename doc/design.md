# Pomodoro Time Keeper

## Features

Based on Pomodoro Time Management

* 25 mins work, 5 mins break, default
* 15 min (long break) every 4 pomodoros, dflt

Includes time tracking to review past estimates vs actuals

* Although break-timing and estimates are based on Pomodoros, actual
  time tracking is kept to minute accuracy, with default history
  displays in terms of pomodoros.

Saves data in the cloud, but also works offline

## Configuration

* Setup activity categories (English, Math, Science...)
* Assign color coding by activity category
* When renaming an activity category, asks whether this is "new" or just a renaming
  of an existing activity (in which case, tracking history will continue)

## Daily session:

* Plan activities and estimates in terms of Pomodoros
* Each activity gets:
  * Activity category
  * Estimated number of Pomodoros
  *  Optional activity details
  * E.g.,
      * English: Write outline, 2 Poms
      * French: <no details>, 1 Pom
      * Math: Study for test, 2 Poms

## Work:

* Activities are listed, select which one to work on
* Click "Start/Resume" Activity, which starts session
* At end of Pomodoro, alarm sounds, start break, alarm ends break
* Can "Pause" timer (pauses also tracked)
* End Session when done
